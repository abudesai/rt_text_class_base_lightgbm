This is a Text Classifier that uses a LightGBM Classifier.

The data preprocessing step includes tokenizing the input text, applying a tf-idf vectorizer to the tokenized text, and applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to find the optimal factors coming from the original matrix. In regards to processing the labels, a label encoder is used to turn the string representation of a class into a numerical representation.

Hyperparameter Tuning (HPT) is conducted on LightGBM's 3 hyperparameters: boosting_type, num_leaves, and learning_rate.

During the model development process, the algorithm was trained and evaluated on a variety of datasets such as email spam detection, customer churn, credit card fraud detection, cancer diagnosis, and titanic passanger survivor prediction.

This Text Classifier is written using Python as its programming language. The python package lightgbm is used to implement the main algorithm. SciKitLearn creates the data preprocessing pipeline and evaluates the model. Numpy, pandas, and NLTK are used for the data preprocessing steps. SciKit-Optimize was used to handle the HPT. Flask + Nginx + gunicorn are used to provide web service which includes two endpoints- /ping for health check and /infer for predictions in real time.
